Software Engineering 101 Project by Yu Tong Liu and Kevin Li



Some information about our files for organization purposes:

    - To run the program: only upload to Arduino Uno board is main.ino

    - Arduinotest folder is to make sure every inputs and outputs are working porperly (they are not part of the final product)

    - Input files/Output files are the raw functions for each functionality we need (as explored in experimental prototyping)  

    - For organization purposes, a library called morseLib was created to add most of the functions in an organized manner instead of all in a single file 
      (it also makes it reusable) and was written is C++
  
    - The last folder, otherFunctions, is functions that we wanted to be implemented, but do to the lack a memory, had to leave out of the final product
      It includes a fun feature that checks if the word written is part of the 100 most common English words (outputs green if yes, and red otherwise)
